Jekyll-Vfolio is a jekyll theme that is suitable for creators making films and videos. It makes easier to update videos and films without the need of a database. [Jekyll makes it possiple to do so.](/jekyll-static-site-generator)

Jekyll-Vfolio makes it easier to add new videos, update video URLs, add/edit metadata about the video using Yaml files in `_data` folder.

For example, in order to make changes to `/film-reel` page use the `film-reel.yml` located at `/_data`.

In order to update the video for sample video just change the  values of `videoID` and `videotype` in these lines of `film-reel.yml` file.
<br>_Note: you may use the instructions given in the `comments` section of the Yaml files._

## Features of Jekyll-Vfolio
- Customizable
