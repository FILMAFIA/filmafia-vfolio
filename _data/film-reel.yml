# Under each heading there is an option to embedd a video either from youtube or vimeo.
# Use the value 'youtube' for youtube video or 'vimeo' for vimeo video in front of 'videotype:'. Note- values are case-sensitive
# For example, for embeding a youtube video the code might look like below
# videotype: youtube
# After putting the appropriate value in front of 'videotype:'. We need to extract the 'VideoID:' from the video URL.
# For example here is video URL of our sample video uploaded on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka8QpnRUAhA
# It could be in the form of https://youtu.be/Ka8QpnRUAhA
# VideoID in this case is Ka8QpnRUAhA
# we just need to enter the videoID from the video link.
